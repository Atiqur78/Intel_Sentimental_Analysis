5.0 out of 5 starsBest CPU for Budget Ballers.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2024,"This processor is great mid to high range budget builds, if your looking for a cpu for around 10K INR, this is the perfect choice, it has 6 Cores and 12 Threads which is quite powerful. For me, pairing it with RX 6600 gave me around 120 FPS in almost all games while playing on High Graphics. About the stock cooler, the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away, i experienced less than 60° while gaming, although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that, but the stock cooler will do its job.Overall 9.5/10 product.Read more"

For me, pairing it with RX 6600 gave me around 120 FPS in almost all games while playing on High Graphics. About the stock cooler, the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away, i experienced less than 60° while gaming, although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that, but the stock cooler will do its job.Overall 9.5/10 product.Read more"

,,Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2023,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.Read more"

,,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.Read more"

,,Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2023,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.Read more"

,,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.Read more"

Pero con una buena refrigeración liquida, que ya son bastante buenas, se controla.Me gustó mucho, sin demeritar a la competencia AMD que lo está haciendo genial también.

,,Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2023,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.Read more"

,,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.Read more"

Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.Read more"

,,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.Read more"

Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.Read more"

,,Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2023,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.Read more"

,,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.
